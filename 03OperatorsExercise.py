#Easy
#Write a program to add two numbers
number0 = 30
number1 = 15
print(number0 + number1)

#Medium
#Solve manually: 2 + 3 * 4 = 14
#Write a program to solve this equation
print(2 + 3 * 4)
#Did you get the same answer? Yes

#Hard
#Use a logical operator in between to comparison operators and
#return the value as true
print(5>3 or 6 == 2)
